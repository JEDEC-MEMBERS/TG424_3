## 1 JEDEC Members please be advised that use of JEDEC Github repositories are subject to the following terms and conditions:
### - The JEDEC BoD Guidelines for using Github (see below) must be followed
  - This repository falls under Use Case A, which means it is confidential, non-public and strictly limited to development purposes within a TG
  - Per the Guidelines, Github is an entirely optional tool and in no instance is it permitted to replace use of the JEDEC members’ website
- [JEDEC website Terms & Conditions of Use](https://www.jedec.org/termsofuse) apply
## 2 Guidelines for Using Github or other Open Source Repositories in JEDEC
Github is a widely used tool to collaboratively develop material including the option to publish material.
Two use cases were approved by the JEDEC Board of Directors in November 2021, subject to the following Guidelines. Arnaud Lebegue, JEDEC Director of Information Technology, is the point of contact for new Github
requests.

- Use Case A: JEDEC-internal revision control system for JEDEC standards

- Use Case B: Open Source Projects for material supporting the adoption of JEDEC standards, such as drivers. JEDEC Board pre-approval is required for new projects using Github or other Open Source repositories under Use Case B, which should be obtained via a Board ballot on the JEDEC voting machine.
### Use Case A: JEDEC Internal Revision Control System

- Repositories are always confidential (non-public) and strictly limited to development purposes within a TG

- Publication of the JEDEC standard developed follows current JEDEC procedures, i.e., it will not use Github

- Since Github is used strictly as internal revision control system in this use case, no license agreement is needed / no BoD approval is needed 

### Use Case B: Open Source Project

- Github and other repositories enable Open Source Projects for JEDEC-relevant work
- Starting any Open Source Project and its scope requires BoD Approval
- Open Source Projects are hosted by a TG
- TG(s) responsible for activities under Use Case B are required to report out to their parent committee on their Github or other Open Source activity during committee meetings
- Publications for Open Source Projects are approved by the TG Chair hosting the project
- Publication of material supporting a JEDEC standard cannot precede the publication of the supported JEDEC standard itself
- Contributors to JEDEC Open Source Projects agree to their contribution becoming published (via
Github or other Open Source repository)
- Legal Protection of JEDEC is guaranteed via no-indemnification via a License Agreement
- The License Agreement has to be included in all Open Source Code

- Example for Use Case B
  -TG 42.3_4 wants to standardize the operations of Secure Flash
  - Therefore, definition of software application interface (APIs) is valuable to user and OS vendors
   - Reference implementations of these APIs will establish and accelerate adoption of the standard
   - The TG wants to make such a reference implementation available via no-indemnification License Agreement

### Additional Board Notes

During the November 2021 Board meeting, the Board clarified that Github is an entirely optional tool and its use is at the discretion of individual committees and in no instance is it permitted to replace use of the JEDEC members’ website. JEDEC-sponsored memberships will be limited to two (2) per TG: the
chair of the responsible TG and one additional member. While the fees are minor, staff time involved in maintenance of access to the Github accounts is a consideration.

Policy Adopted by the JEDEC Board of Directors in February 2022
